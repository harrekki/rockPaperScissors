# rockPaperScissors
A JavaScript program to play Rock, Paper, Scissors for The Odin Project 

This program will play 5 rounds of the game in a web browser and tally the scores of both the player and the computer.
In the event of a draw, no points will be awarded, and the game will advance to the next round.
A the end of the game, a winner will be declared, and the player is asked if he/she would like to play again.

Proposed Changes:

+correct logic of decision to determine winner to reject garbage value from user and reprompt
+change endOfFile if statement to a loop so that player is asked about replay after every game
